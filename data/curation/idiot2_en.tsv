#text=He pulled out a pack of cards , wrapped in a bit of paper , from his pocket , and handed them to the prince . The latter took them , with a sort of perplexity . A new , sad , helpless feeling weighed on his heart ; he had suddenly realized that not only at this moment , but for a long while , he had not been saying what he wanted to say , had not been acting as he wanted to act ; and that these cards which he held in his hand , and which he had been so delighted to have at first , were now of no use--no use ... He rose , and wrung his hands . Rogojin lay motionless , and seemed neither to hear nor see his movements ; but his eyes blazed in the darkness , and were fixed in a wild stare
