#text=The tongue is a muscular hydrostat on the floors of the mouths of most vertebrates which manipulates food for mastication . It is the primary organ of taste ( gustation ) , as much of the upper surface of the tongue is covered in papillae and taste buds . It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva , and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels . In humans a secondary function of the tongue is phonetic articulation . The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning one 's teeth . [ 2 ] The ability to perceive different tastes is not localised in different parts of the tongue , as is widely believed . [ 3 ] This error arose because of misinterpretation of some 19th-century research ( see tongue map )
