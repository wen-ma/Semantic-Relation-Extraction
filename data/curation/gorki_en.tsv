#text=In our present state of culture hunger of the mind is more quickly satisfied than hunger of the body . You wander about the streets , you are surrounded by buildings not bad - looking from the outside and - - you may safely say it - - not so badly furnished inside , and the sight of them may excite within you stimulating ideas about architecture , hygiene , and many other wise and high - flying subjects . You may meet warmly and neatly dressed folks - - all very polite , and turning away from you tactfully , not wishing offensively to notice the lamentable fact of your existence . Well , well , the mind of a hungry man is always better nourished and healthier than the mind of the well - fed man ; and there you have a situation from which you may draw a very ingenious conclusion in favour of the ill fed

#text=The evening was approaching , the rain was falling , and the wind blew violently from the north . It whistled in the empty booths and shops , blew into the plastered window - panes of the taverns , and whipped into foam the wavelets of the river which splashed noisily on the sandy shore , casting high their white crests , racing one after another into the dim distance , and leaping impetuously over one another 's shoulders . It seemed as if the river felt the proximity of winter , and was running at random away from the fetters of ice which the north wind might well have flung upon her that very night . The sky was heavy and dark ; down from it swept incessantly scarcely visible drops of rain , and the melancholy elegy in nature all around me was emphasised by a couple of battered and misshapen willow - trees and a boat , bottom upwards , that was fastened to their roots
