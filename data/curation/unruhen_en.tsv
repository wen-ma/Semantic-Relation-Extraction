#text=The riots were sparked by the fatal shooting by police of 29 - year - old Mark Duggan on Thursday in Tottenham , during the planned arrest of Duggan as part of anti - gun unit Operation Trident . Reports from the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) claimed that Duggan had been shot in retaliation , however the IPCC later admitted there is no evidence that Duggan shot at the police . On Sunday , a peaceful protest in Tottenham held by Duggan 's family and friends sparked a series of disturbances in the area , which quickly became a violent riot , with youths from the area looting and clashing with Police
