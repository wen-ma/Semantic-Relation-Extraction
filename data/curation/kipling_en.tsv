#text=It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day 's rest , scratched himself , yawned , and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips . Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling , squealing cubs , and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived . " Augrh ! " said Father Wolf . " It is time to hunt again . " He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined : " Good luck go with you , O Chief of the Wolves . And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world .

But they are afraid of him too , because Tabaqui , more than anyone else in the jungle , is apt to go mad , and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone , and runs through the forest biting everything in his way . Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad , for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature . We call it hydrophobia , but they call it dewanee - - the madness - - and run
