#text=Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis , or skin . Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals . The human body , apart from areas of glabrous skin , is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair . Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth , hair types and hair care , but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein , notably keratin . Attitudes towards hair , such as hairstyles and hair removal , vary widely across different cultures and historical periods , but it is often used to indicate a person 's personal beliefs or social position , such as their age , gender , or religion .
