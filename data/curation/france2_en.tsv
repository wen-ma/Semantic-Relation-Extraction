#text=Slowly she uncoiled her hair before the chimney-glass ; then she looked mournfully at the ring she wore on the ring-finger of her left hand , a little silver ring on which the face of Marat , all worn and battered , could no longer be made out . She looked at it till the tears confused her sight , took it off softly and tossed it into the flames . Then , her face shining with tears and smiles , transfigured with tenderness and passion , she threw herself into Philippe 's arms . The night was far advanced when the _citoyenne_ Blaise opened the outer door of the flat for her lover and whispered to him in the darkness : " Good-bye , sweetheart ! It is the hour my father will be coming home . If you hear a noise on the stairs , go up quick to the higher floor and do n't come down till all danger is over of your being seen . To have the street-door opened , give three raps on the _concierge's_ window . Good-bye , my life , good-bye , my soul ! " The last dying embers were glowing on the hearth when Élodie , tired and happy , dropped her head on the pillow
