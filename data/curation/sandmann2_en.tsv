#text=Nathaniel awakened as from a heavy , frightful dream ; he opened his eyes , and felt an indescribable sensation of pleasure streaming through him , with soft heavenly warmth . He was in bed in his own room , in his father 's house , Clara was stooping over him , and Lothaire and his mother were standing near . " At last , at last , oh beloved Nathaniel , hast thou recovered from thy serious illness--now thou art again mine ! " So spoke Clara , from the very depth of her soul , and clasped Nathaniel in her arms . But with mingled sorrow and delight did the brightly glowing tears fall from his eyes , and he deeply groaned forth : " My own--my own Clara ! " Sigismund , who had faithfully remained with his friend in the hour of trouble , now entered . Nathaniel stretched out his hand to him . " And thou , faithful brother , hast not deserted me ? " Every trace of Nathaniel 's madness had vanished , and he soon gained strength amid the care of his mother , his beloved , and his friends . Good fortune also had visited the house , for an old penurious uncle , of whom nothing had been expected , had died , and had left the mother , besides considerable property , an estate in a pleasant spot near the town . Thither Nathaniel , with his Clara , whom he now thought of marrying , his mother , and Lothaire , desired to go . Nathaniel had now grown milder and more docile than he had ever been , and he now understood , for the first time , the heavenly purity and the greatness of Clara 's mind . No one , by the slightest hint , reminded him of the past . Only , when Sigismund took leave of him , Nathaniel said : " Heavens , brother , I was in an evil way , but a good angel led me betimes to the path of light ! Ah , that was Clara ! " Sigismund did not let him carry the discourse further for fear that deeply wounding recollections might burst forth bright and flaming . It was about this time that the four happy persons thought of going to the estate . They were crossing , at noon , the streets of the city , where they had made several purchases , and the high steeple of the town-house already cast its gigantic shadow over the market-place . " Oh , " said Clara , " let us ascend it once more , and look at the distant mountains ! " No sooner said than done . Nathaniel and Clara both ascended the steps , the mother returned home with the servant , and Lothaire , not inclined to clamber up so many steps , chose to remain below . The two lovers stood arm in arm in the highest gallery of the tower , and looked down upon the misty forests , behind which the blue mountains were rising like a gigantic city

#text=" Look there at that curious little gray bush , which actually seems as if it were striding towards us , " said Clara . Nathaniel mechanically put his hand into his breast pocket--he found Coppola 's telescope , and he looked on one side . Clara was before the glass . There was a convulsive movement in his pulse and veins , -- pale as death , he stared at Clara , but soon streams of fire flashed and glared from his rolling eyes , and he roared frightfully , like a hunted beast . Then he sprang high into the air , and , in the intervals of a horrible laughter , shrieked out , in a piercing tone , " Wooden doll--turn thyself ! " Seizing Clara with immense force he wished to hurl her down , but with the energy of a desperate death-struggle she clutched the railings . Lothaire heard the raging of the madman--he heard Clara 's shriek of agony--fearful forebodings darted through his mind , he ran up , the door of the second flight was fastened , and the shrieks of Clara became louder and louder . Frantic with rage and anxiety , he dashed against the door , which , at last , burst open . Clara 's voice became fainter and fainter . " Help--help--save me ! " -- with these words the voice seemed to die in the air . " She is gone--murdered by the madman ! " cried Lothaire . The door of the gallery was also closed , but despair gave him a giant 's strength , and he burst it from the hinges . Heavens--Clara , grasped by the mad Nathaniel , was hanging in the air over the gallery , -- only with one hand she still held one of the iron railings . Quick as lightning Lothaire caught his sister , drew her in , and , at the same moment , struck the madman in the face with his clenched fist , so that he reeled and let go his prey

#text=Lothaire ran down with his fainting sister in his arms . She was saved . Nathaniel went raging about the gallery and bounded high in the air , crying , " Fire circle turn thyself--turn thyself ! " The people collected at the sound of the wild shriek , and among them , prominent by his gigantic stature , was the advocate Coppelius , who had just come to the town , and was proceeding straight to the market-place . Some wished to ascend and secure the madman , but Coppelius laughed , saying , " Ha , ha , -- only wait--he will soon come down of his own accord , " and looked up like the rest . Nathaniel suddenly stood still as if petrified ; he stooped down , perceived Coppelius , and yelling out , " Ah , pretty eyes--pretty eyes ! " -- he sprang over the railing
