#text=Reasons for a preference for boxers can be attributed to their variety of styles and design and their general appearance while worn , as well as their ability to provide high levels of natural comfort and freedom relative to other male undergarments . Unlike traditional briefs or the more modern boxer briefs , boxers allow for more freedom in the selection of a fabric type and print design
