#text=Big Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for his son and his elephant , and now that he had found them he looked at them as though he were afraid of them both . And there was a feast by the blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants , and Little Toomai was the hero of it all . And the big brown elephant catchers , the trackers and drivers and ropers , and the men who know all the secrets of breaking the wildest elephants , passed him from one to the other , and they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a newly killed jungle-cock , to show that he was a forester , initiated and free of all the jungles

He shall become greater than I , even I , Machua Appa ! He shall follow the new trail , and the stale trail , and the mixed trail , with a clear eye ! He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he runs under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers ; and if he slips before the feet of the charging bull elephant , the bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him .
