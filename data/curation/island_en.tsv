#text=The grounding is because the volcanic ash drawn into the jet stream is of a particle size which allows it to remain aloft in the atmosphere . Ingestion of this foreign matter , because of its distribution , would lead to flame outs in all aircraft engines . The composition of the ash also means that it would first melt into glass if it were to enter the engine of an aircraft before solidifying again as it cooled . This could lead to damage to the compressors and fan blades , which would make it impossible to restart the engines , even if the aircraft were to exit the cloud The grounding is because the volcanic ash drawn into the jet stream is of a particle size which allows it to remain aloft in the atmosphere .
