But I warn you , if you do n't tell me that this means war , if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend , no longer my ' faithful slave , ' as you call yourself ! But how do you do ? I see I have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news .

#text=" Heavens ! what a virulent attack ! " replied the prince , not in the least disconcerted by this reception . He had just entered , wearing an embroidered court uniform , knee breeches , and shoes , and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face . He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought , and with the gentle , patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court . He went up to Anna Pavlovna , kissed her hand , presenting to her his bald , scented , and shining head , and complacently seated himself on the sofa
