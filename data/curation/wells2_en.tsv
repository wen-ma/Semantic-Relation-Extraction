#text=The broadening of men 's views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated . Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere . Now we see further . If the Martians can reach Venus , there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men , and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable , as at last it must do , it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils

#text=I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind . I sit in my study writing by lamplight , and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames , and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate . I go out into the Byfleet Road , and vehicles pass me , a butcher boy in a cart , a cabful of visitors , a workman on a bicycle , children going to school , and suddenly they become vague and unreal , and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot , brooding silence . Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent streets , and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer ; they rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten . They gibber and grow fiercer , paler , uglier , mad distortions of humanity at last , and I wake , cold and wretched , in the darkness of the night

#text=I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the Strand , and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past , haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched , going to and fro , phantasms in a dead city , the mockery of life in a galvanised body . And strange , too , it is to stand on Primrose Hill , as I did but a day before writing this last chapter , to see the great province of houses , dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and mist , vanishing at last into the vague lower sky , to see the people walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill , to see the sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still , to hear the tumult of playing children , and to recall the time when I saw it all bright and clear-cut , hard and silent , under the dawn of that last great day . . .
