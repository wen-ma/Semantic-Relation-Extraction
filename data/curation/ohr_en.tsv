#text=Often the entire organ is considered the ear , though it may also be considered just the visible portion . In most mammals , the visible ear is a flap of tissue that is also called the pinna ( or auricle in humans ) and is the first of many steps in hearing . Vertebrates have a pair of ears placed somewhat symmetrically on opposite sides of the head . This arrangement aids in the ability to localize sound sources
