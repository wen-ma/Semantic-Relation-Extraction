#text=Trousers are an item of clothing worn from the waist to the ankles , covering both legs separately ( rather than with cloth extending across both legs as in robes , skirts , and dresses ) . They are also called pants in the United States , Canada and elsewhere . In the UK and Ireland , the word " pants " generally means underwear and not trousers . [ 1 ] Shorts are similar to trousers , but with legs that come down only to around the area of the knee , higher or lower depending on the style of the garment . To distinguish them from shorts , trousers may be called " long trousers " in certain contexts such as school uniform , where tailored shorts may be called " short trousers " , especially in the UK

#text=In most of the Western world , trousers have been worn since ancient times and throughout the Medieval period , becoming the most common form of lower-body clothing for males in the modern world , although shorts are also widely worn , and kilts and other garments may be worn in various regions and cultures . Since the mid-20th century , trousers have increasingly been worn by females as well . Jeans , made of denim , are a form of trousers for casual wear , now widely worn all over the world by both sexes . Shorts are often preferred in hot weather or for some sports , and also often by children and teenagers . Trousers are worn at the hips or waist , and may be held up by their own fastenings , a belt , or suspenders ( braces ) . Leggings are form-fitting trousers , of a clingy material , often knitted cotton and spandex ( elastane )
