#text=The kilt is a knee-length garment with pleats at the rear , originating in the traditional dress of men and boys in the Scottish Highlands of the 16th century . Since the 19th century it has become associated with the wider culture of Scotland in general , or with Celtic ( and more specifically Gaelic ) heritage even more broadly . It is most often made of woollen cloth in a tartan pattern
