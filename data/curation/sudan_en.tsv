#text=Kiir insisted that martyrs for the cause of the new country did not die in vain , although South Sudan waited 56 years to be free . The southern Sudanese had agitated for more rights , even before Sudan became free from its British colonizers in 1956 . Sudan was divided into three separate demographic groups , with the southern part of the country home to Christians and animists and the northern part dominated by Arab populations and those of Muslim faith . Kiir said to people of Abyei , Darfur , Blue Nile and South Kordofan , who remain part of Sudan , that " we have not forgotten you . When you cry , we cry . When you bleed , we bleed . I pledge to you today that we will find a just peace for all .

#text=Two million individuals died in the civil war between the two territories of Sudan and Southern Sudan and four million more exiled , a war that was waged for decades . Control of south Sudan 's oil rich reserves was the primary reason for the fighting . An agreement of peace was signed in 2005 , effectively bringing the war to an end , and Sudan became one of the first countries to recognise South Sudan . Under the regulations of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement , Sudan held an independence referendum . In excess of 99 % of those participating in the vote agreed to the concept of independence for South Sudan

#text=South Sudan remains a desperately poor country , with one in five of its inhabitants chronically hungry , only one third having access to safe drinking water and with the world 's highest rate of maternal death . The country lacks infrastructure such as roads and railways . It remains torn by ethnic and tribal rivalries and many problems with the north remain unresolved , including the exact boundary line . Important revenue for Sudan has come from the rich oilfields of the south , keeping the country afloat and essential now for both economies . A formula remains to be developed on how to split these revenues between the two areas
