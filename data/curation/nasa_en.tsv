#text=According to images captured by NASA 's QuikSCAT satellite , the Arctic icecap has lost at least 14 % of its ' perennial ' ice between 2004 and 2005 . Data shows that at least 280,000 square miles of ice , at least the size of Texas has been lost . The eastern Arctic has lost at least 50 % of its ice , but scientists say that ice was shifted by wind and other weather factors from the east to the west Arctic , causing the western areas of ice to actually grow
