#text=Muskmelon ( Cucumis melo ) is a species of melon that has been developed into many cultivated varieties . These include smooth skinned varieties such as honeydew , crenshaw and casaba , and different netted cultivars ( cantaloupe , Persian melon and Santa Claus or Christmas melon ) . The Armenian cucumber is also a variety of muskmelon , but its shape , taste , and culinary uses more closely resemble those of a cucumber . The large number of cultivars in this species approaches that found in wild cabbage , though morphological variation is not as extensive . It is a fruit of a type called pepo . Muskmelon is native to Iran , Anatolia , Armenia , and adjacent areas on the west and the east which is believed to be their center of origin and development , with a secondary center including the northwest provinces of India and Afghanistan . Although truly wild forms of C. melo have not been found , several related wild species have been noted in those regions
