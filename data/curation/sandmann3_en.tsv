#text=In your childish mind the frightful sandman in the nurse 's tale was naturally associated with old Coppelius , who , even if you had not believed in the sandman , would still have been a spectral monster , especially dangerous to children . The awful nightly occupation with your father , was no more than this , that both secretly made alchemical experiments , and with these your mother was constantly dissatisfied , since besides a great deal of money being uselessly wasted , your father 's mind being filled with a fallacious desire after higher wisdom was alienated from his family--as they say , is always the case with such experimentalists . Your father no doubt , by some act of carelessness , occasioned his own death , of which Coppelius was completely guiltless . Would you believe it , that I yesterday asked our neighbour , the clever apothecary , whether such a sudden and fatal explosion was possible in such chemical experiments ? " Certainly , " he replied , and in his way told me at great length and very circumstantially how such an event might take place , uttering a number of strange-sounding names , which I am unable to recollect . Now , I know you will be angry with your Clara ; you will say that her cold disposition is impenetrable to every ray of the mysterious , which often embraces man with invisible arms , that she only sees the varigated surface of the world , and has the delight of a silly child , at some gold-glittering fruit , which contains within it a deadly poison

#text=If there is a dark power , which with such enmity and treachery lays a thread within us , by which it holds us fast , and draws us along a path of peril and destruction , which we should not otherwise have trod ; if , I say , there is such a power , it must form itself within us , or from ourselves ; indeed , become identical with ourselves , for it is only in this condition that we can believe in it , and grant it the room which it requires , to accomplish its secret work . Now , if we have a mind , which is sufficiently firm , sufficiently strengthened by cheerful life , always to recognise this strange hostile operation as such , and calmly to follow the path which belongs to our inclination and calling , then will the dark power fail in its attempt to gain a power , that shall be a reflection of ourselves . Lothaire adds that it is certain , that the dark physical power , if of our own accord , we have yielded ourselves up to it , often draws within us some strange form , which the external world has thrown in our way , so that we ourselves kindle the spirit , which , as we in our strange delusion believe , speaks to us in that form . It is the phantom of our own selves , the close relationship with which , and its deep operation on our mind casts us into hell , or transports us into heaven . You see , dear Nathaniel , that I and my brother Lothaire have freely given our opinion on the subject of dark powers , which subject , now I find I have not been able to write down the chief part without trouble , appears to me somewhat deep . Lothaire 's last words I do not quite comprehend . I can only suspect what he means , and yet I feel as if it were all very true . I beg of you , get the ugly advocate , Coppelius , and the barometer-seller , Giuseppe Coppola , quite out of your head . Be convinced that these strange fears have no power over you , and that it is only a belief in their hostile influence that can make them hostile in reality . If the great excitement of your mind did not speak from every line of your letter , if your situation did not give me the deepest pain , I could joke about the Sandman-Advocate , and the barometer-seller , Coppelius . Be cheerful , I have determined to appear before you as your guardian-spirit , and if the ugly Coppelius takes it in his head to annoy you in your dreams , to scare him away with loud peals of laughter . I am not a bit afraid of him nor of his disgusting hands ; he shall neither spoil my sweetmeats as an advocate , nor my eyes as a sandman . Ever yours , my dear Nathaniel
